                <p>Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I'm am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan. Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance. That's good advice, Marty. Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught it'll be four tardies in a row.</p>

                <p>My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. What a nightmare. You bet. Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests, what do they like to do together? Yeah, who are you?</p>

                <p>Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. Nothing, nothing, nothing, look tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George? Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine.</p>

                <p>Lorraine, are you up there? Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home. He's your brother, Mom.</p>

                <p>Precisely. What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new. I'll call you tonight. Ah well, sort of. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88.</p>

                <p>We do now. I'm gonna ram him. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space. Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar.</p>

                <p>Thank you. In about thirty years. you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think she was born a nun. Precisely. Marty, are you alright?</p>

                <p>About 30 years, it's a nice round number. Hello. Hey McFly, what do you think you're doing. What's with the life preserver? Well looky what we have here. No no no, you're staying right here with me.</p>

                <p>Looks like a airplane, without wings. Next, please. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Leave me alone. We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go no where.</p>

                <p>Next, please. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. Sit here, Marty. Doc. Erased from existence.</p>
